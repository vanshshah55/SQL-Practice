--More than one non clustered index can exist while that is not the case with clustered index

--Clustered Index determines the physical order in which data is stored in a table while that is
--not the case with non clustered index

--Clustered indexes are slightly faster than non-clustered indexes. 
--If there are columns not present in the non-clustered index, SQL Server must refer back to the table, requiring an additional lookup. 
--This makes non-clustered indexes slower in such cases.

--Clustered index is faster than non clustered index because non clustered index needs to refer back to
--table if selected column is not present in it

--Non clustered index requires separate disc space for storage, whereas clustered indexes are created on the same table.
